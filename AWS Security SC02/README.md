**How I studied for the exam**

Udemy Training Course
The course I used to study with is the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-security-specialty/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923). Although I did not know much about AWS, through the course and reading the official documentation on AWS, it was enough for me to prepare theoretical knowledge.

AWS Documentation
The resource I used to practice was the AWS official documentation. The AWS website is a fountain of useful information, which will not just help you study, but also help you day-to-day when you are using AWS Security features & services.

Practice Exams
Although Stephane Maarek has his own course with questions, I advise all participants to include as many questions as possible. Some questions can be repeated on the exam, and by solving the quizzes you can expand your knowledge and solve some doubts during your studies. Additional questions can be found on Udemy if you have access from the company or for payment on the Tutorial Dojo site [Url](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-security-specialty-exam-guide-study-path-scs-c02/).

**Exam Experience**

The exam is proctored online, meaning that you will need to install a piece of software which will monitor your screen; it will also record you via your laptop webcam, including any sound. It means that you must be in a quiet room with no distractions. You can read more about that on their website. I advise that you download and test the software (there is a connectivity checker) which you can run before the exam. This just confirms your webcam, microphone and internet connection are all working correctly.

Once your exam window opens, you can begin the exam, at which point you will be connected to remote proctor, to monitor you during the exam. They will verify your identity by asking you to present a valid form of identification (ID card, passport or driving licence) to ensure it is really you taking the exam. I used their phone apllication to picture my room and document.

Once that is complete they will ask you to show them the room, to ensure there is no-one else present and that there are no materials in sight which might allow for cheating. I must emphasize that the table you are working on must be clean. Any device must be out of reach of hands. Read the exam conditions before starting the exam, this will include all the information you need to know before the exam begins.

**Hints For The Exam**

The exam lasts 180 minutes, so read each question very CAREFULLY and several times. Look at the key points in the question, because the details in the answers may depend on it. For any question you are not sure about, you can leave a review flag and come back to them later. I recommend watching this video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkJK1uKKYWw) before takeing the exam questions.
