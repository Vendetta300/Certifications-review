**How I studied for the exam**

CyberWarFareLabs Documentation and videos<br />
  • The resource I used to read was ther listed documentation in PDF foramt. The CyberWarFareLabs also provide video tutorials for every cloud provider AWS, Azure and GCP.

Official Documentation from AWS/Azure/GCP<br />
  • In addition to official materials, I also used documentation from the heads of three cloud providers in order to learn more and study their concept of work.

**Udemy Course**

  • The Udemy course I found useful for AWS and Azure part:<br />
    1. AWS - [Introduction to AWS Pentesting](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-aws-pentesting/?kw=intro+to+aws+pent&src=sac&couponCode=CM251225G1)<br />
    2. Azure - [Intro To Azure Pentesting Course - Hacking Azure](https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-pentesting-course-hacking/?kw=intro+to+azure+pente&src=sac&couponCode=CM251225G1)<br />

**Exam Experience**

  • The exam is online, since you are login to their platform where you must submit all required flags. You can use any tools and OS, they recommending their own OS RedCloud, I personally used Kali Linux where I installed the CLI tools. You must not share captured flags wiht others on Discord community. The platform was very stable during exam.

<br />

**Hints For The Exam**

• Consider next:<br />
1. Think Creative -All the necessary information is found in their materials, it is just necessary to apply it differently.<br />
2. Use hints if you stuck - You can always use hitns to get additionl help.<br />
3. OWASP Top 10 -Pay attention to SSRF attacks.<br />
4. Persistence and patience - You don't have a set time for which you can solve the flags. Without stress, the idea will come over time how to solve the task <br />
